#Python Modules

* All python files are modules.

* You can always import python files and run in terminal.

* Run with:  
 ` python <file_name>.py  `
	 OR:  
` import <file_name>.py  `
    	  `<function_inside>(<parameters>)`

* `git checkout` takes changes back to old commit, in case of merge errors (local behind) for local to put

* _Merge conflicts_ = two people editing same file at around the same spot, Git gets confused


#### Python web development:  
 `app.route(<route_name>)`
  * Calls function, so you generally return string  

	    def route_name():  
        return "My HTML page"
