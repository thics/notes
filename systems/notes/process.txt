SOTD: Shine - Collective Soul

Aim: Are your processes running? - Then you should go out and catch them!

Do Now: Run the command ps in a terminal. What do you see?

Processes
	Every running program is a process. A proess can
	create subprocesses, but these are no different from
	regular processes.

	A procesor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core).
	"Multitasking" appears toh appen because the processor
	switches between all the activate processes quickly.

	pid
		Every process has a unique identifier called the pid.

		pid 1 is the init process

		Each entry in the /proc directory is a current pid

	getpid() - <unistd.h>
		 returns the current process' pid

	getppid() - <unistd.h>
		returns the current process' parent pid

	fork() - <unistd.h>
	       	Creates a separate process based on the current one,
		the new process is called the child, the original is
		the parent.

		The child process is a duplicate of the parent process.
		All parts of the parent process are copied,
		including stack and heap memory, and the file table.
