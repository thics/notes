SOTD: For What It's Worth - Buffalo Springfield

Aim: I need information, stat!

Do Now:
   1) Make a directory
   2) Put a few files in that directory and maybe even a directory or two

stat - <sys/stat.h>

     Get information about a file (metadata)

     stat( <PATH>, <STAT BUFFER> )
     	   struct stat sb;
	   stat("foo", &sb);

     STAT BUFFER

     	  Must be a pointer to a struct stat

	  All the file information gets put into the stat buffer.

	  Some of the fields in struct stat:
	       st_size
	             file size in bytes

	       st_uid, st_gid
	       	       user id, group id

	       st_mode
		       file permissions

	       st_atime, st_mtime
	       	       last access, last modification
