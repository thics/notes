#Aim: Always read the fine print.

#####Do Now: Open up your editor of choice (emacs), write a basic "Hello World" program in java.

###Data Types and Variables
 - Character literals are single characters inside ''

		'a', '*' ...

-  String literals exist, even though there is no String data type.

		"hello", "you smell"

- In C, string = array of chars, last element = 0 (null)

- Any variable type can be declared an "unsigned" variable.
- This signifies the variable will never be negative.
 - The lower bound of any unsigned variable is 0.
 - The upper bound will be greater than the signed version.

    		unsigned char x;
	    	0 <= x <= 255

		    char x;
	    	-128 <= x <= 127 (taking space from negatives)

- Variables cannot be declared inside for loops statements, but they can be initialized
